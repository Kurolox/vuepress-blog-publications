I wanted to have a place where I could write about anything I'm working at the moment, and having a place where I can polish my english is also nice. However, I didn't just wanted to have a blog. I wanted to <em>make</em> a blog. And here you are.</p> <p>Now, let's be honest. This blog is completely barebones right now. However, I didn't want to deploy a fully-fledged website from the get-go because that would take time. Instead, I want to slowly build upon this base and keep improving the site.</p> <p>One of the things I wanted to do most was to write the articles using markdown. This would allow me to have some easy syntax for formatting the articles, support for code markdown, being able to write the articles however I wanted rather than being locked with some sort of browser-based WYSIWYG editor and, most importantly, having the articles being independant from the blog itself. That will allow me to modify the blog however I want without having to fear the loss of the articles I've written.</p> <p>Now, regarding how this blog is made. This website is generated with <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vuepress<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, a static site generator that uses Vue under the hood. I already have some experience with Vue (albeit only a bit), and being a static site generator means that I don't really have to worry about hosting. I <em>could</em> host it, don't get me wrong: Hosting is cheap and I've got an odroid C2 laying around doing nothing. However, I find the static approach to have more appeal since it allows me to also learn and practise another skill: Continuous Delivery.</p> <p>You see, this blog is hosted in GitHub. I've got two repositories: One where I have the source of the blog with the articles written in markdown, and another one where the generated static files are deployed. I use <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> to automate the deployment, so all I have to do is push a new markdown file to the github repository and Travis deals with everything else.</p> <p>I'd like to mention that I haven't made any of this from scratch.
